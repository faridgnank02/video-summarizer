## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

Video Summarizer is an AI system that automatically creates summaries from video content. The system extracts transcripts from various sources and processes them using natural language models to generate clear, concise summaries.

This project tackles the problem of information overload by helping users understand video content without watching entire recordings. It's useful for education, work, and research where time is limited but content understanding is essential.

### 1.2 Core Functionality

The system handles different input types: YouTube videos, local video files, and direct text. It uses two AI models that work together:

- **LED (Longformer Encoder-Decoder) Model**: A transformer model built for long documents that works offline and costs nothing to use
- **OpenAI GPT Models**: Cloud-based models that process content quickly and handle multiple languages well

The system picks the best model automatically based on what kind of content you're working with and what's available at the moment.

```python
class ModelManager:
    def select_optimal_model(self, text_length, language, user_preference)
    def is_model_available(self, model_type)
```

### 1.3 Technical Architecture

The project uses a modular design where each part handles a specific job. The main parts are data ingestion, text processing, model management, quality checking, and system monitoring.

You can use it through a web interface built with Streamlit or connect to it programmatically using REST API endpoints. This makes it work both for direct users and for integration into other applications.

```python
# Main application structure
src/
├── data/           # Handle input data
├── models/         # AI model management  
├── evaluation/     # Quality assessment
├── monitoring/     # System tracking
├── api/           # REST endpoints
└── ui/            # Web interfaces
```

### 1.4 Key Features

The system checks transcript quality before processing and gives confidence scores for the summaries it creates. If something goes wrong with the main model, backup systems kick in automatically.

Real-time monitoring keeps track of how the system is performing and how people are using it. The quality checking uses several methods including ROUGE scores, semantic similarity, and custom metrics to measure how good the summaries are.

```python
@dataclass
class EvaluationMetrics:
    rouge_1_f: float          # Word overlap
    semantic_similarity: float # Meaning similarity  
    coherence_score: float    # Text flow quality
    overall_score: float      # Combined rating
```

The system is optimized for Apple Silicon chips (M1, M2, M3) using Metal Performance Shaders for faster processing.

## 2. Data Ingestion and Processing Pipeline

### 2.1 Multi-Source Data Ingestion

The system can handle different types of input sources. For YouTube videos, it uses the YouTube Transcript API to get existing transcripts in various languages. If the first language doesn't work, it tries others automatically.

```python
class YouTubeTranscriptExtractor:
    def get_transcript(self, video_url, language=None)
    def extract_video_id(self, url)
```

For local files, it supports common video formats (MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, WebM) and audio formats (MP3, WAV, M4A). When transcripts aren't available, it uses Whisper models to create them from the audio.

The system handles errors well - network problems, API limits, and corrupted files don't crash it. It also extracts useful information like video length, language, and quality indicators.

### 2.2 Text Preprocessing Pipeline

Raw transcripts need cleaning before they can be summarized effectively. The cleaning process removes YouTube-specific stuff like timestamps `[00:15]`, speaker labels, music tags `[Music]`, and applause markers that don't help with understanding the content.

```python
class TextCleaner:
    def clean_text(self, text)
    def normalize_text(self, text)
```

The system also removes URLs, email addresses, and repeated characters while keeping the actual content intact. It fixes punctuation and spacing to make everything consistent.

Quality checking looks at how coherent the transcript is - checking if words make sense, if sentences are properly formed, and if the vocabulary is diverse enough. Poor quality transcripts get flagged with warnings.

### 2.3 Content Segmentation and Validation

The preprocessing splits text intelligently, keeping sentences together while staying within model limits. The LED model can handle up to 16,384 tokens, while OpenAI models have different limits depending on which version you're using.

```python
def _is_text_valid_for_summarization(self, text)
def _assess_transcript_quality(self, transcript)
```

The system checks content quality by looking at language patterns and vocabulary consistency. If content quality is too low, it rejects it and suggests alternatives.

Language detection happens automatically so the system can pick the right model and use appropriate prompts. It works mainly with French and English but can be extended to other languages.

### 2.4 Caching and Performance Optimization

The system caches processed transcripts using content hashes to avoid doing the same work twice. The cache has configurable retention rules and cleans itself up automatically to manage disk space.

```python
class DataIngestion:
    def get_cached_transcript(self, content_hash)
    def cache_transcript(self, content_hash, transcript_data)
```

Performance improvements include streaming for large files, parallel processing for multiple items, and efficient memory usage. The system tracks processing times and resource usage to spot where it can do better.

## 3. AI Models and Implementation

### 3.1 LED Model Architecture

The LED (Longformer Encoder-Decoder) model is the core of the offline summarization system. It's built on transformer architecture but modified to handle very long documents - up to 16,384 tokens compared to typical models that max out around 512 tokens.

```python
class LEDSummarizer:
    def __init__(self, model_name, device)
    def _get_device(self, device)
    def summarize(self, text, summary_type)
```

The model uses attention patterns that scale efficiently with document length. Instead of computing attention between every token pair (which would be expensive), it uses a sliding window approach combined with global attention on key tokens.

For Apple Silicon chips (M1, M2, M3), the system uses Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) which can make processing 1.5x faster than CPU while using less memory and generating less heat.

### 3.2 OpenAI Integration

The OpenAI integration provides fast, high-quality summaries through GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo models. The system uses carefully crafted prompts that adapt based on the desired summary length and language.

```python
class OpenAISummarizer:
    def __init__(self, api_key, model_name)
    def summarize(self, text, summary_type, language)
    def _track_usage(self, tokens, cost)
```

The system tracks API usage including token consumption and costs. It also implements automatic fallback to GPT-3.5-turbo if GPT-4 is unavailable or rate-limited.

### 3.3 Model Selection Logic

The model manager automatically chooses the best model based on several factors. For long English texts, LED often works better. For multilingual content or when speed is critical, OpenAI models are preferred.

```python
class ModelManager:
    def select_optimal_model(self, request)
    def _get_fallback_model(self)
    def generate_summary(self, request)
```

The system also checks model availability in real-time. If the LED model fails to load (insufficient memory, missing dependencies), it automatically switches to OpenAI. If OpenAI is unavailable (no API key, network issues), it falls back to LED.

### 3.4 Generation Parameters and Quality Control

Both models use carefully tuned generation parameters to ensure quality output. The LED model uses beam search with specific penalties to avoid repetition and encourage conciseness.

```python
# LED generation configuration
generation_config = {
    'num_beams': 4, 'length_penalty': 2.0, 'repetition_penalty': 1.3,
    'no_repeat_ngram_size': 4, 'early_stopping': True
}
```

The system includes quality validation for generated summaries. It checks for coherence, proper sentence structure, and meaningful content. Low-quality outputs trigger regeneration with different parameters or fallback to the alternative model.

```python
def _validate_summary_quality(self, summary, original_text)
def _has_excessive_repetition(self, text)
def _compute_similarity(self, text1, text2)
```

## 4. System Architecture and Components

### 4.1 Web Interface (Streamlit)

The main user interface is built with Streamlit, providing an intuitive web application for video summarization. The interface handles multiple input types and provides real-time feedback during processing.

```python
class VideoSummarizerApp:
    def __init__(self)
    def render_main_interface(self)
    def process_youtube_video(self, url)
    def process_local_file(self, file)
```

The interface includes progress bars, quality indicators, and error handling with user-friendly messages. It also provides model comparison features and summary history tracking.

### 4.2 REST API (FastAPI)

The system exposes a comprehensive REST API for programmatic access. The API supports text summarization, YouTube processing, batch operations, and system monitoring.

```python
app = FastAPI(
    title="Video Summarizer API",
    description="Professional API for automatic video summarization",
    version="2.0.0"
)

@app.post("/api/v1/summarize/text")
async def summarize_text(request: TextSummaryRequest)

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check()

@app.post("/api/v1/summarize/youtube") 
async def summarize_youtube(request: YouTubeSummaryRequest)
```

The API includes authentication, rate limiting, and comprehensive error handling. It also provides endpoints for health checks, model status, and system metrics.

### 4.3 Monitoring Dashboard

A separate monitoring dashboard tracks system performance, user activity, and model effectiveness. It's built as a standalone Streamlit application with real-time charts and alerts.

```python
class MonitoringDashboard:
    def render_system_metrics(self)
    def render_performance_charts(self)
    def render_model_usage_stats(self)
```

The dashboard shows processing times, error rates, model performance comparisons, and user behavior patterns. It also includes alert management for system issues.

### 4.4 Database and Storage

The system uses SQLite for metrics storage and file-based caching for processed content. The database schema tracks performance metrics, user interactions, and system events.

The database schema includes tables for system metrics, performance tracking, and user interactions.

```python
class MetricsCollector:
    def record_performance_metric(self, operation, model_name, processing_time)
    def get_system_metrics(self)
    def get_business_metrics(self)
```

The storage system includes automatic cleanup, backup capabilities, and data export functions for analysis.

### 4.5 Configuration Management

The system uses YAML configuration files for flexible parameter management. Configuration is split between application settings and model parameters.

Configuration uses YAML files for app settings, UI parameters, API configuration, and monitoring options.

```python
class ConfigManager:
    def __init__(self, config_path)
    def get(self, key_path, default)
    def reload_config(self)
```

Configuration changes are detected automatically and applied without requiring system restart for most parameters.

## 5. Evaluation and Quality Assurance

### 5.1 Automatic Quality Assessment

The system includes a comprehensive evaluation framework that automatically assesses summary quality using multiple metrics. This helps users understand how good their summaries are and helps the system improve over time.

```python
```python
@dataclass
class EvaluationMetrics:
    rouge_1_f, rouge_2_f, rouge_l_f: float
    semantic_similarity, coherence_score: float  
    overall_score: float
```
```

The evaluation happens automatically when users request it, providing immediate feedback on summary quality. This helps users decide if they need to try different settings or models.

### 5.2 ROUGE Metrics Implementation

ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) scores measure how much overlap exists between the generated summary and reference texts. The system calculates multiple ROUGE variants to get a complete picture.

```python
class SummaryEvaluator:
    def calculate_rouge_scores(self, generated_summary, reference_text)
    def calculate_semantic_similarity(self, summary, original_text)
```

ROUGE-1 measures word overlap, ROUGE-2 looks at two-word phrases, and ROUGE-L finds the longest matching sequences. Higher scores generally mean better summaries, but they need to be interpreted alongside other metrics.

### 5.3 Semantic Similarity Analysis

Beyond word overlap, the system measures how well the summary preserves the original meaning using sentence embeddings and cosine similarity.

```python
def assess_coherence(self, text)
def _analyze_sentence_flow(self, sentences)
```

Semantic similarity helps catch cases where a summary uses different words but preserves meaning, while coherence analysis ensures the summary flows well and makes sense.

### 5.4 Quality Thresholds and Recommendations

The system uses configurable quality thresholds to categorize summaries and provide recommendations to users.

```python
class QualityAssessment:
    def assess_and_recommend(self, metrics)
    def get_quality_category(self, score)
```

The system provides specific recommendations based on which metrics are low. For example, low semantic similarity might suggest trying a different model, while low coherence might indicate input text quality issues.

### 5.5 Continuous Quality Monitoring

The evaluation system tracks quality trends over time to identify patterns and potential issues. This helps with system maintenance and improvement.

```python
def track_quality_trends(self, evaluation_result)
def trigger_quality_alert(self, message)
```

The monitoring system can detect when summary quality drops, which might indicate model issues, input data problems, or system configuration changes that need attention.

### 5.6 A/B Testing Framework

The system includes basic A/B testing capabilities to compare different models, parameters, or approaches on the same content.

```python
class ABTestManager:
    def run_comparison_test(self, text, test_configs)
    def compare_results(self, results)
```

This helps optimize model parameters and compare different approaches systematically rather than relying on subjective assessment.

## 6. Monitoring and Performance

### 6.1 Real-Time System Monitoring

The system includes comprehensive monitoring that tracks both technical performance and business metrics. It monitors CPU, memory, disk usage, and GPU utilization in real-time to ensure optimal performance.

```python
```python
@dataclass
class SystemMetrics:
    cpu_percent, memory_percent, disk_usage_percent: float
    
class MetricsCollector:
    def collect_system_metrics(self)
    def start_collection(self)
```
```

The collector runs in a background thread and stores metrics in SQLite for historical analysis. It can detect resource bottlenecks and performance degradation automatically.

### 6.2 Performance Tracking

Every summarization request is tracked with detailed performance metrics including processing time, input/output lengths, model used, and success status.

```python
```python
@dataclass 
class PerformanceMetrics:
    operation, model_name: str
    processing_time: float
    success: bool
    
@track_performance
def summarize_text(text, model):
    # Function automatically tracked
```
```

This tracking helps identify slow operations, memory leaks, and performance patterns across different content types and models.

### 6.3 Alert System

The monitoring system includes an intelligent alert system that can detect anomalies and notify administrators of potential issues.

```python
class AlertManager:
    def add_alert_rule(self, name, condition, threshold, action)
    def check_alerts(self)
    def _trigger_alert(self, rule, metrics)
```
```

Alerts can be configured for various conditions like high resource usage, error rates, slow processing times, or model failures.

### 6.4 Business Metrics

The system tracks business-relevant metrics to understand usage patterns and system effectiveness.

```python
```python
class BusinessMetricsTracker:
    def record_request(self, user_id, model_used, processing_time)
    def get_current_metrics(self)
```
```

These metrics help understand user behavior, popular models, processing volumes, and system effectiveness over time.

### 6.5 Performance Optimization

The monitoring data is used to automatically optimize system performance. The system can adjust model parameters, manage memory usage, and balance load based on observed patterns.

```python
class PerformanceOptimizer:
    def optimize_model_selection(self)
    def manage_memory_usage(self)
    def _clear_model_caches(self)
```

The optimizer runs periodically and makes automatic adjustments to maintain optimal performance without manual intervention.

### 6.6 Dashboard and Reporting

All monitoring data is visualized through interactive dashboards that provide both real-time views and historical analysis.

```python
def render_performance_dashboard(self):
    # Real-time metrics with Streamlit
    # Performance charts with Plotly
```

The dashboard includes charts for processing times, error rates, resource usage, model performance comparisons, and user activity patterns.
